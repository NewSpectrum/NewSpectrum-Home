# Codes of Conduct

__Please read-__ *or __at least__ skim* through the relevant __Codes of Conduct__ before posting/contributing in __[New Spectrum's Repositories](https://github.com/NewSpectrum/repositories)__ and/or __[Chat Servers](url)__.

# Posting on GitHub

When posting anything to __New Spectrum's__ __[GitHub Forums]__, our __Codes of Conduct__ isn't much different from that of the __[GitHub Community Code of Conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-code-of-conduct)__.

Furthermore, (although this part should go without saying) *any* and __*all*__ content posted to __*GitHub as a Whole-*__ regardless of the user or organization, *must* comply with __[GitHub's Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies)__.

## GitHub's Policies: TLDR

Because I would honestly be shocked if anyone got *this* far in __*my*__ boring policy documentation, I know for a fact that the odds of me winning the lottery *while getting struck by lightning* are better than those of you *actually* reading either of the aforementioned documents.

### TLDR: Community Code of Conduct

As long as you have a solid understanding of __"Acceptable Social Behavior"__, as well as a legitimate understanding of the elusive and *not-so-common* __[Common Sense](url)__, the __[GitHub Community Code of Conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-code-of-conduct)__ should be a long list of no-brainers.

Regardless, nobody's perfect, and warning labels exist for a reason. :slightly_smiling_face:

#### [Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines#maintaining-a-strong-community)
- __Be Welcoming & Open-Minded__
	- Please be aware that the community is full of users of all kinds. Most are developers, some are just users looking for answers. Be open to other ideas *and* experience levels.
- __Be Respectful__
	- The goal for social collaboration is __[Constructive Criticism](url)__.
	- We aren't here to generate hostility, and any attempts to do so will not be tolerated.
