# Oops

Sorry, the __file__, __wiki__, or __documentation__ you clicked on is either under construction and *hilariously* ill-prepared for public viewing, or it hasn't even been created yet.

## Wondering what happened?

Allow me to explain either possibility...


### Why doesn't it exist?

If it truly doesn't exist, you found your way here because a __Wiki Page__, __README__, or other similar document was (or is being) written with the links/references pre-configured to match a file that has not yet been created- or a destination (e.g. some external resource) that hasn't been found/properly referenced. Though this might be an annoying experience, for which I apologise, this is still the most efficient way of creating properly-referenced documentation.


### What does *hilariously ill-prepared* mean, precisely?

If the documentation you were *supposed* to find here does, in fact, exist but you *still* found this page instead, that means the document probably looks something like this:

```markdown
# Wiki/README Title

Captivating introduction *coming eventually*.

<!-- Expandable 'Table of Contents' -->
<details id="toc_container" open>
    <summary>
        <h2 id="table-of-contents"
            style="display: inline">
            Table of Contents
        </h2>
    </summary>
    <h3>
        <a href="section">
            Section
        </a>
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <a href="sub-section">
            Sub-Section
        </a>
    </ul>
</details>

# Section

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

## Sub-Section

That's all folks.
