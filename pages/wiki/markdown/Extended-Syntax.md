# Markdown Extended Syntax

Before we dive into it, I would like to quickly credit the __[MarkdownGuide.org](https://markdownguide.org/)__[^MarkdownGuide], from which most (if not all) of the information in this particular Wiki Page was collected. Shold this Wiki leave you wanting, or if you would like to pay hommage to the source (always nice), you should also check out their guide on __[Markdown's Extended Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)__
